# @ Mention System Implementation

## Overview

The chat interface now features a Discord-style inline mention system that replaces the previous dropdown-based recipient selector. Users can target specific participants by typing `@username` directly in the message input, with autocomplete suggestions appearing as they type.

## Key Features

### 1. Autocomplete Popup
- Triggered automatically when user types `@` character
- Filters participant list in real-time based on query text
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys, Enter/Tab to select, Escape to dismiss
- Mouse click selection support
- Avatar icons with gradient backgrounds for visual appeal

### 2. Visual Feedback
- **Highlighted mentions**: `@username` patterns render as blue-highlighted spans in message bodies
- **Live mention styling**: The chat input overlays typed mentions with pill-shaped highlights and animates them after selection
- **Mention badges**: Messages mentioning the current user show a yellow "You were mentioned" badge
- **Border accent**: Messages with mentions to you have a distinct yellow left border
- **Typing indicators**: Input placeholder guides users to "Type @ to mention someone..."

### 3. Smart Notification Logic
- **Targeted notifications**: Only users explicitly mentioned in a message receive notifications
- **Silent broadcasts**: Messages without mentions are sent to all participants but generate no notifications
- **Self-exclusion**: Users don't get notified of their own messages, even if they mention themselves

### 4. Flexible Messaging
- **Single mention**: `@Alice Can you help?` → Only Alice notified
- **Multiple mentions**: `@Bob @Charlie Meeting at 3pm` → Both Bob and Charlie notified
- **Broadcast**: `Lunch break time!` → Everyone sees it, no one notified
- **Mixed content**: Regular text mixed with mentions seamlessly

### 5. Mention Guardrails
- **Duplicate prevention**: Selecting an already-mentioned participant flashes the existing pill instead of inserting a second copy
- **Attention cue**: The glowing flash animation confirms which mention was reused so users stay oriented

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### HTML Structure (`webui/index.html`)
```html
<div class="chat-input-wrapper">
  <div id="chat-input-overlay" class="chat-input-overlay" aria-hidden="true"></div>
  <input type="text" id="chat-input" placeholder="Type @ to mention someone..." autocomplete="off" />
  <div id="mention-popup" class="mention-popup"></div>
</div>
```

Removed the `<select id="chat-recipient" multiple>` dropdown entirely.

#### CSS Styling (`assets/styles.css`)
- `.mention-popup`: Autocomplete dropdown positioned below input
- `.mention-item`: Individual suggestion items with hover/selected states
- `.mention-avatar`: Circular gradient avatars for participants
- `.chat-message .body .mention`: Blue highlighted @username spans
- `.chat-message.has-mention`: Yellow accent for messages mentioning current user
- `.mention-badge`: "You were mentioned" indicator in message meta

#### JavaScript Logic (`assets/main.js`)

**State Management**:
```javascript
let mentionStartPos = -1;      // Position of @ in input
let mentionQuery = "";         // Text after @
let mentionSelectedIndex = -1; // Currently selected popup item
let mentionMatches = [];       // Filtered participant list
```

**Core Functions**:

1. `handleChatInputChange(event)`: Detects `@` character, extracts query, shows popup
2. `handleChatInputKeydown(event)`: Handles arrow keys, Enter, Escape, Tab for navigation
3. `showMentionPopup(query)`: Filters participants, populates popup with matches
4. `hideMentionPopup()`: Clears state and hides popup
5. `updateMentionSelection()`: Updates visual selection in popup
6. `insertMention(username)`: Inserts `@username` into input at cursor position
7. `parseMentions(text)`: Extracts all valid `@username` patterns from message text

**Message Rendering**:
- `appendChatMessage()` parses message body with regex `/@(\w+)/g`
- Creates `<span class="mention">@username</span>` for valid participants
- Adds `.has-mention` class if current user is mentioned
- Only triggers notification if current user is mentioned (not just a recipient)

**Form Submission**:
- Extracts mentions using `parseMentions(message)`
- Sends `{ message, recipients: mentions }` if mentions exist
- Sends `{ message }` (broadcast) if no mentions
- Clears mention state after sending

### Backend (No Changes Required)

The existing protocol already supports the `recipients` field in `ChatMessage`:

```python
@dataclass
class ChatMessage:
    sender: str
    message: str
    timestamp_ms: int
    recipients: list[str] | None = None  # Already supported
```

Server-side routing in `control_server.py` and history filtering in `session_manager.py` work seamlessly with the new mention-based targeting.

## User Experience Flow

1. **User types `@`**: Popup appears with all participants
2. **User types `a`**: Popup filters to names starting with 'a'
3. **User presses Arrow Down**: Highlights next match
4. **User presses Enter**: Inserts `@alice ` into input
5. **User types message**: "Can you review this?"
6. **User presses Send**: Message goes to Alice with notification
7. **Alice sees message**: Yellow border, mention badge, blue @alice highlight
8. **Other users see message**: Normal display, no notification

## Benefits Over Previous System

| Previous (Dropdown) | New (@ Mentions) |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Separate UI control for recipients | Inline, natural typing experience |
| Select before typing message | Mention while typing message |
| All recipients always notified | Only mentioned users notified |
| Dropdown takes vertical space | Clean, compact input area |
| Desktop-focused interaction | Works well on mobile too |
| Less discoverable | Familiar Discord/Slack pattern |

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support required
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Regex lookbehind/lookahead not used (broad compatibility)
- Graceful degradation: if popup fails, users can still send messages

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation fully supported (arrows, Enter, Escape, Tab)
- Focus management returns to input after selection
- Visual indicators for selected item (background color)
- Screen readers can announce mention badges
- ARIA attributes can be added for enhanced screen reader support

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

- **Fuzzy matching**: Match usernames anywhere in the name, not just prefix
- **Recent mentions**: Prioritize recently mentioned users in autocomplete
- **Mention persistence**: Store mention preferences per user
- **Notification sounds**: Different sounds for mentions vs. broadcasts
- **Mention history**: Show all messages mentioning current user
- **Auto-suggest**: Suggest mentions based on context (e.g., previous participants in thread)
- **Group mentions**: Support `@everyone` or `@channel` patterns
- **Mention analytics**: Track who mentions whom for insights

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Autocomplete behavior**: Type various queries, verify filtering accuracy
2. **Keyboard navigation**: Test all arrow key combinations, Enter, Escape, Tab
3. **Multiple mentions**: Verify multiple `@username` patterns in single message
4. **Notification targeting**: Confirm only mentioned users receive notifications
5. **Edge cases**: Empty mentions (`@`), invalid usernames (`@unknown`), self-mentions
6. **Performance**: Test with large participant lists (50+ users)
7. **Mobile**: Verify touch interaction on tablets/phones
8. **Cross-browser**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Migration Notes

No database migration required. Existing chat history displays correctly with the new rendering logic. The `recipients` field in stored messages is preserved and still used for filtering history.

Users should be informed of the new mention system through:
- In-app tutorial or tooltip on first use
- Updated help documentation
- Change notification in the UI

## Conclusion

The @ mention system transforms the chat from an explicit selection model to a natural, inline mention model similar to popular platforms like Discord and Slack. This improves usability, reduces UI clutter, and provides smarter notification targeting that respects user attention.
